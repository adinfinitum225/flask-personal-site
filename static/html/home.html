				<h2>My Quick Bio</h2>
				<p>
				This is where I'll give the elevator pitch version of my "about me" section. Something short and sweet that hits the basics
				</p>
				<h2>Main Info</h2>
				<p>
				Future aggregate feed or something, or just a rotating selection of apps. Possibly even a blog of projects that aren't data science, or a plant report. A plant report would be nice, maybe a little video feed to see the flowers and the insects.
