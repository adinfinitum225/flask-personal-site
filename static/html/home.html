				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
				<img id="portrait" src="media/self_photo_resized.jpg" alt="Portrait" width="120" height="164">
				Problem solving is my specialty, and I'm driven toward connecting patterns into a bigger picture. 
				</p>
				<p>
				All my life I have never been able to leave a problem alone. If something seems off or isn't working right I have to mess with it, discover how it works, and use that understanding to come up with a solution. It's no surprise that I gravitated towards mathematics and chemistry in college. The problems and patterns were more abstract, but they were still there all the same. There was nothing quite like the feeling of being able to put all the pieces together for that difficult math proof or problem. 
				</p>
				<p>
				That desire to understand also means I have broken and fixed more computers than I can remember. I have always had a lot of coding and technical knowledge but never really brought it all together until I finished the UT Austin Data Analysis and Visualization bootcamp. Taking that class showed me that working with data is the best way to combine my love of math, programming, and problem solving.

				<h1>Main Info</h1>
				<p>
				Future aggregate feed or something, or just a rotating selection of apps. Possibly even a blog of projects that aren't data science, or a plant report. A plant report would be nice, maybe a little video feed to see the flowers and the insects.
